      "ForestlyGames is the most professional Roblox development group that I have worked with in my time on the platform. As a business associate and a casual player of many of the games that Forestly has put out, I can confidently say that the team has a strong commitment towards quality and customer satisfaction in all of its endeavors. Organizing the release of a game while managing schedules, deadlines, and platform updates is a very tricky operation, but Jath and Lourdes have demonstrated great skill in balancing the many changing needs of the team. The expertise that they have gained rivals that of professional game developers that I have worked with outside of the Roblox platform.",
