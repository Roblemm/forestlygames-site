# PROJECT BRIEF

## Project Name
ForestlyGames Website Redesign

## Project Type
Marketing website for a game studio, not a web app.

## Purpose
This website exists to present ForestlyGames as a polished, credible, modern game studio.

It should:
- Make a strong first impression.
- Communicate studio identity.
- Attract talent and collaborators.
- Build trust with partners and investors.
- Showcase games clearly as proof of creative and technical capability.
- Create interest in contacting the studio.

It is a brand and credibility showcase first, not a product application.

## What This Website Is
- A game studio marketing website.
- A showcase for games, studio identity, and credibility.
- A visually polished, motion-driven experience.
- Mobile-friendly and performance-aware.
- Built for strong UX and strong presentation.

## What This Website Is Not
- Not a dashboard.
- Not a SaaS product site.
- Not a login-based application.
- Not a backend-heavy platform.
- Not a CMS-heavy system in this phase.
- Not a place for complex user accounts, profiles, or personalized features.

## Target Audience

### 1) Talent
Potential hires, contributors, and future team members.

They should feel:
- This is a high-standard creative environment.
- The studio has vision and momentum.
- The work looks exciting and polished.

### 2) Collaborators
Potential creative and technical collaborators, including developers, artists, contractors, and partner-builders.

They should feel:
- This studio is serious.
- This studio ships.
- This studio has a clear aesthetic and direction.
- Working with this team would raise the quality of their own portfolio.

### 3) Partners and Investors
Potential business partners, sponsors, organizations, and investors.

They should see:
- Professionalism.
- Credibility.
- Quality of output.
- Strong presentation and brand presence.
- Evidence of execution, momentum, and long-term potential.

### 4) Players (Secondary Audience)
People discovering ForestlyGames and its games.

They should quickly understand:
- What kinds of games are made.
- What looks fun or interesting.
- Why ForestlyGames is worth paying attention to.

## Primary Goals

### 1) Impressive First Impression
The homepage should immediately feel premium, modern, and game-native.

### 2) Game Discovery
Users should be able to quickly notice and explore featured games.

### 3) Credibility and Perception
The site should communicate that ForestlyGames is capable, quality-focused, and operating with serious standards, even as the studio continues growing.

### 4) Strong Brand Identity
The website should reflect a cinematic, polished, motion-forward style, not a generic template look.

### 5) Smooth Mobile Experience
The website should feel good on phones, not just desktop.

## UX Priorities
- Scroll-driven motion is a major part of the experience.
- Motion should feel cinematic and layered.
- Motion should not make the site feel laggy or hard to use.
- Navigation should be clear and fast.
- The site should feel visually impressive without becoming cluttered.

## Non-Goals (Current Phase)
The following are explicitly out of scope for this phase unless later approved:
- Login or authentication.
- User accounts.
- Complex backend systems.
- Admin panels.
- E-commerce checkout.
- Large database-driven features.
- Community or social platform features.
- Heavy CMS architecture.
- Over-engineered infrastructure for future hypothetical features.

## Pages In Scope (Phase 1)
- `/` (Home)
- `/games`
- `/about`
- `/contact`

## Possible Future Pages (Not In Scope Right Now)
These may be added later, but are not part of Phase 1:
- Individual game detail pages.
- Careers / Work With Us.
- Studio news / blog.
- Partner company site or backend-heavy product site.
- Talent / hiring portal.

## Success Criteria

### UX and Visual Quality
- Strong first impression within the first few seconds.
- Premium-feeling visual design.
- Scroll-based motion feels intentional and impressive.
- Motion enhances the experience instead of distracting from it.

### Mobile Experience
- Layout works cleanly on mobile.
- Motion is still smooth and readable on mobile.
- Interactions are touch-friendly.
- No major mobile layout breakage.

### Performance and Smoothness
- The site feels smooth during scrolling.
- Motion does not noticeably stutter on common phones and laptops.
- Page navigation feels quick.
- Visual richness does not come at the cost of usability.

### Content and Clarity
- Users can understand what ForestlyGames is.
- Talent and collaborators can quickly understand the studio's quality bar and direction.
- Partners and investors can quickly understand the studio's professionalism and potential.
- Users can find games easily.
- Users can reach contact and collaboration info easily.
- The website feels credible and professional.

## Build Constraints (Current Phase)
- Code-first website, not Wix page builder.
- Focus on frontend and UX polish.
- Keep architecture clean for AI-assisted development.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity that makes AI edits unstable.
- Prefer clear structure and scoped changes over giant rewrites.

## AI Guidance Intent
This brief exists to prevent AI tools from inventing features, pages, or product directions that are not part of the current project.

When generating or editing code, AI should align to:
- Marketing site goals.
- Motion-forward UX goals.
- Mobile-friendly design.
- Phase 1 page scope.
- Simplicity over speculative backend features.
