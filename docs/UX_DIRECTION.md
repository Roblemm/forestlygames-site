# UX DIRECTION

## Purpose of This Document
Define the visual style, motion feel, and UX taste for the ForestlyGames website so AI tools do not make random design choices.

This document should be used alongside the Project Brief.

## Why This Matters
AI can build something that is technically good, but stylistically wrong.

This document exists to keep the site aligned to the intended brand feel:
- premium
- cinematic
- game-native
- motion-forward
- credible to talent, collaborators, partners, and investors

## Brand Impression Goal
When someone lands on the site, the reaction should be:

"Whoa, these people look like the real deal."

The site should feel like a serious creative studio with taste, momentum, and execution quality.

## Reference Sites and What We Like

### Closest Overall
- **INK Games**
  - Best overall reference for motion-heavy UX direction.
  - Strong scroll choreography and layered movement.
  - Premium, modern, game-forward feel.
  - Great game section interaction and presentation.
  - Important note: some homepage motion feels laggy, so use this as inspiration for style, not performance budget.

### Best Hero Direction
- **Riot Games**
  - Strong hero presence and confidence.
  - Clear first impression with game-native identity.
- **INK Games**
  - Strong motion and visual energy.
  - Feels alive immediately.

### Best Game Section Direction
- **INK Games**
  - Game showcase feels polished and exciting.
  - Browsing feels premium, not generic.
  - Motion supports discovery instead of feeling separate from the content.

## UX Vibe Keywords
Use these as the default style filter for design decisions:
- **cinematic**
- **premium**
- **game-first**
- **scroll-driven**
- **modern**

Supporting vibe words that also fit:
- polished
- high-standard
- confident
- layered
- immersive
- credible

## What To Avoid
The site should not drift into any of these directions:

### 1) Generic SaaS Feel
Avoid layouts and styling that feel like a startup dashboard or productivity tool.

Examples of what to avoid:
- plain feature grids with generic icons
- bland section structures with no atmosphere
- overly safe typography and spacing choices
- corporate blue product-site visuals

### 2) Over-Corporate Layouts
Avoid making the site feel too formal, sterile, or investor deck-like.

The site should feel credible, but still creative and game-native.

### 3) Cluttered Arcade Chaos
Avoid noisy layouts with too many competing colors, effects, or motion elements.

The site should feel exciting and alive, but controlled.

### 4) Laggy Motion Overload
Avoid heavy motion that makes scrolling feel choppy or hard to use.

Motion is a core part of the experience, but smoothness and readability still matter.

## Navigation Philosophy
Navigation should feel polished, but it is not the main motion showcase.

### Core Rule
- **Scroll motion is the star**
- **Navbar and menu motion should be polished**
- **Route transitions should be light and fast**

### What This Means in Practice
- Navbar can animate on scroll state change, open/close, and active link states.
- Mobile menu should feel smooth and intentional.
- Route changes should feel crisp, not theatrical.
- The biggest "wow" moments should come from scroll-linked motion inside pages, especially the homepage.

## Motion Style Direction (High Level)
This is a motion-forward website, not just a site with hover effects.

The desired motion feel is:
- layered movement while scrolling
- relative motion between elements
- parallax depth
- scene-like transitions between sections
- premium pacing, not constant chaos

Important:
- Hover effects are polish, not the main identity.
- Scroll choreography is the main identity.

## Audience-Driven UX Priorities
Because the site primarily needs to impress talent, collaborators, partners, and investors, the UX should prioritize:
- confidence and visual quality
- clear evidence of execution (games, proof, presentation)
- professional polish
- strong creative identity

Players still matter, but player-focused browsing should not make the site feel cheap or toy-like.

## Content Presentation Tone
The design should communicate:
- We make games.
- We care about craft.
- We have taste.
- We are serious about quality.
- We are building real momentum.

It should not communicate:
- We are a template site.
- We are a generic startup.
- We are trying to impress with noise instead of polish.

## Decision Filter for AI-Generated Designs
When AI proposes a design direction, evaluate it with these questions:

1. Does this feel game-native and premium?
2. Does this feel like a real studio with high standards?
3. Is the motion supporting the content, or distracting from it?
4. Is the scroll experience more impressive than the hover effects?
5. Does this still feel good on mobile?
6. Does this look polished enough to impress talent, collaborators, and investors?

If the answer to multiple questions is no, revise the direction before implementing.

## Summary
The target direction is:

**Cinematic, premium, scroll-driven, game-first UX with strong motion choreography and controlled performance.**
